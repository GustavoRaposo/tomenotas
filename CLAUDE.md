# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Tomenotas — a personal voice-notes assistant for Ubuntu/GNOME, implemented as a
Python package (`src/tomenotas/`, the daemon: tray icon + D-Bus + recording)
plus bash scripts for listing/reading notes, and an installer/uninstaller.
The Python side is a proper package (pyproject.toml, pytest, 90% coverage gate
on the core); the bash side remains glue code around system tools. All
comments, `notify-send` messages, and user-facing strings are in Portuguese —
keep new code consistent with that.

There is no cloud/API/LLM involved anywhere in this project by design (see README):
speech-to-text and text-to-speech both run fully offline via local binaries. Don't
introduce network calls to AI services when extending this project.

## Architecture

Recording goes through the daemon (Fase 1 of ROADMAP.md); listing/reading are
still standalone scripts communicating through shared files under
`~/.local/share/tomenotas/`:

- **`src/tomenotas/`** — the daemon package, split so all logic is pure and
  testable, with I/O injected:
  - `core.py` — the state machine (idle → recording → transcribing), fully
    synchronous, no GTK/D-Bus/threads. `toggle()` returns a `ToggleAction`
    telling the glue what to do next.
  - `recorder.py` / `transcriber.py` / `notes.py` / `notify.py` /
    `player.py` — thin injectable wrappers around `arecord`, whisper.cpp,
    note files (list/save/delete/search via `Note.matches`), `notify-send`,
    and Piper+`paplay` playback. User-facing error messages are raised as
    `TranscriptionError` / `PlayerError`.
  - `config.py` — reads `~/.config/tomenotas/config.json` (written by
    `install.sh`; whisper + piper paths) with `TOMENOTAS_*` env overrides.
    This replaced the old sed-patching for the daemon.
  - `shortcuts.py` — GNOME keybindings via the `gsettings` CLI (injectable
    run): get/set the three tomenotas custom-keybindings (same ids/paths
    `install.sh` registers) and conflict detection (`list_conflicts`) across
    wm/shell/mutter/media-keys schemas and other custom entries.
  - `status.py` — Fase 4 mapping state → tray icon name/tooltip plus the
    `Pulsador` (alternates strong/dim icon variants; AppIndicator can't
    animate). Icon SVGs live in `assets/icons/` and are installed to
    `~/.local/share/tomenotas/icons/`; the glue falls back to system icons
    (no pulse) if that dir is missing. `DaemonCore.on_state_change` is the
    observer hook — it may fire from the transcription worker thread, so
    the glue wraps it in `GLib.idle_add`.
  - `logs.py` — Fase 5 structured logging: modules log via
    `logging.getLogger("tomenotas.<mod>")`; `setup_logging()` (called in
    `daemon.main`) attaches a rotating file handler writing to
    `~/.local/share/tomenotas/daemon.log` (idempotent per target file).
  - `daemon.py` + `window.py` + `settings_window.py` — the **glue layer**:
    GTK main loop, `AyatanaAppIndicator3` tray with
    "Abrir"/"Configurações"/"Sair", D-Bus name `com.tomenotas.Daemon` at
    `/com/tomenotas/Daemon` with
    `ToggleRecording()`/`ShowWindow()`/`ShowSettings()`/`Ping()`, threading
    for slow work (transcription, TTS synthesis), the Fase 2 notes window
    (list with preview, search filter, play/pause per note, delete with
    confirmation) and the Fase 3 settings window (click a field, press the
    new key combo → applied to gsettings immediately, with a conflict
    warning dialog; window close hides — the daemon stays in the tray).
    Deliberately thin and dumb: they only build widgets and delegate to the
    tested core. All three are **excluded from coverage** (pyproject omit) —
    keep new behavior out of them and in the core. Recording state lives
    in-process — no `recording.pid`.
  Entry point: `tomenotas-daemon = tomenotas.daemon:main` (console script;
  `install.sh` installs the package into a `--system-site-packages` venv at
  `~/.local/share/tomenotas/venv` and symlinks `~/bin/tomenotas-daemon`).
- **`tomenotas-hotkey-record`** (Super+R) / **`tomenotas-hotkey-window`**
  (Super+L) — thin bash D-Bus clients, the targets of the record/list
  keybindings. They just call `ToggleRecording()` / `ShowWindow()` via
  `gdbus`; if the daemon isn't running the call fails silently, so the
  shortcuts are dead unless the app is open (this is the intended behavior —
  don't "fix" it by falling back to the legacy scripts).
- **`gravar.sh`** / **`listar.sh`** — legacy standalone flows (arecord +
  `recording.pid` + whisper.cpp; zenity list writing `current_note`). Still
  installed for manual use, but no longer bound to keys.
- **`ler.sh`** (Super+T) — reads `current_note` (falling back to the most recent note
  if none is selected or the pointer is stale) and pipes its text through Piper TTS,
  playing the resulting audio with `paplay`.
- **`install.sh`** — installs apt dependencies (including `python3-gi` and
  `gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1` for the daemon), clones/builds whisper.cpp and
  downloads a model, downloads the Piper binary + `pt_BR-faber-medium` voice, copies
  the scripts + daemon + hotkey client to `~/bin`, rewrites the binary/model paths
  in the copies via `sed`, and registers the three keybindings via `gsettings`
  (record → `tomenotas-hotkey-record`, not `gravar.sh`).
- **`uninstall.sh`** — reverses `install.sh`; by default keeps notes and the
  whisper.cpp/Piper installs (large downloads), removable via `--purge-notes` /
  `--purge-deps`.

Key invariant: the **bash scripts** in this repo (`gravar.sh`, `listar.sh`,
`ler.sh`) are **templates**. `install.sh` copies them to `~/bin/` and then patches
the `WHISPER_BIN`/`WHISPER_MODEL`/`PIPER_BIN`/`PIPER_MODEL` variables in the
*copies* with `sed`. When editing these scripts, preserve the exact variable
assignment format the installer's `sed` patterns expect (e.g. `^WHISPER_BIN=.*`),
or update the corresponding `sed` line in `install.sh` to match. The Python
daemon is **not** sed-patched — it reads `~/.config/tomenotas/config.json`
(written by `install.sh`) / `TOMENOTAS_*` env vars via `config.py`.

State/data layout (see README "Onde ficam os arquivos" for the authoritative list):
```

~/bin/tomenotas-hotkey-record   # D-Bus client bound to Super+R
~/bin/tomenotas-hotkey-window   # D-Bus client bound to Super+L
~/.config/tomenotas/config.json # whisper paths, read by the daemon
~/.local/share/tomenotas/
├── venv/              # daemon package install (system-site-packages)
├── notes/*.txt        # transcribed notes, one file per recording
├── current_note       # path to the note selected in listar.sh
└── recording.pid       # only written by the legacy gravar.sh, not the daemon
~/whisper.cpp/          # whisper.cpp build + model
~/piper/                 # Piper binary + voice model
```

## Testing changes

**Python (the daemon): TDD is the workflow.** Any change to `src/tomenotas/`
(except `daemon.py`) starts with a failing test in `tests/`. Run the suite
with:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```
The coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=90`, configured in pyproject.toml) makes
`pytest` fail below 90% on the core; `daemon.py` (GTK/D-Bus glue) is omitted
from the metric on purpose — do not "fix" coverage by adding mock-heavy tests
for it, and do not grow logic inside it: put logic in `core.py` (tested) and
keep the glue delegating.

**Bash scripts + the glue layer:** no automated harness. To validate, install
and exercise the real keyboard-driven flow:
```bash
./install.sh --skip-whisper --skip-piper   # if whisper.cpp/Piper already installed
```
Then start the daemon (`~/bin/tomenotas-daemon &`), manually trigger Super+R
(record/stop), Super+L (list), Super+T (read), and check
`~/.local/share/tomenotas/notes/` and `notify-send` output. Also verify the Fase 1
invariant: quit the daemon via the tray menu and confirm Super+R does nothing.
When editing a single script without reinstalling, run it directly from `~/bin/`
(the installed, path-patched copy), not from this repo checkout, since the checkout
copies have placeholder paths.

## Roadmap context

See `ROADMAP.md` for the v2 plan. All fases (0–5) are done: bash scripts;
daemon skeleton with tray + D-Bus; GTK notes window; settings window for
hotkeys; state-reflecting tray icons with pulse; autostart + structured
logging + specific error messages. Remaining ideas (SQLite storage, note
export/editing, multiple voices, `.deb` packaging, GlobalShortcuts portal)
live in the ROADMAP backlog — none of those exist yet.
